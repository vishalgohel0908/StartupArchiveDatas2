Jeff Bezos exemplifying customer obsession

This clip of Jeff Bezos is the best example of customer obsession I’ve come across:

“If there’s one thing Amazon is about, it’s obsessive attention to the customer experience end-to-end… It doesn’t matter to me whether we’re a pure Internet play. What matters to me is whether we provide the best customer service… Our investors should be investing in a company that obsesses over customer experience. In the long term, there’s never any misalignment between customer interests and shareholder interests.”

Bezos rallied the entire company around the idea that customers will always want low prices, fast delivery and vast selection. And then executed relentlessly on being the absolute best in the world in those three areas.

In a separate interview, he explains why:

“There are many advantages to a customer-centric approach, but here’s the big one: customers are always beautifully, wonderfully dissatisfied, even when they report being happy and business is great. Even when they don’t yet know it, customers want something better, and your desire to delight customers will drive you to invent on their behalf."
