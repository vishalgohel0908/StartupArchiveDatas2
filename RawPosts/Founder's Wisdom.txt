Jony Ive explains the importance of giving form to an abstract idea
“The way we design to start with is to talk. And it’s fairly exclusive—it only involves a few people.”

But, as Jony describes, the greatest change takes place when that abstract idea is given form via a drawing or a plastic model:

“What I’ve noticed is this shift is profound. It really galvanizes and provides focus to an entire team. Very often when they’re struggling with these abstract tentative ideas, you’ve got a sort of flag in many ways. It won’t become the final design, but what it does do is describe what we’re trying to do.”

Jony continues:

“There is just something very special about when you have an object. We’re physical beings, and when there’s an object to touch, everything shifts. It’s always been the case.”

Twitter and Square founder Jack Dorsey gives similar advice to people building something new:

“The hardest thing is to get started, and I think the most important thing that I’ve learned is that you have to get the idea out of your head as soon as you have it. Get it on paper and then take it one step further and just show someone.”
