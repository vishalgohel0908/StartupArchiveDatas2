Twitter cofounder Biz Stone shares the most important lesson he learned in his startup career
“Success is not guaranteed, but failure pretty much is guaranteed if you’re not emotionally invested in what you’re working on.”

Biz believes Odeo - the podcasting company that pivoted into Twitter - failed because the team didn’t care about podcasts:

“We didn’t podcast and we didn’t listen to podcasts. But with Twitter early on, Evan had a tweet that said ‘Sipping pinot noir after a massage in Napa Valley’ and it made me laugh out loud. I had kind of an out of body experience because I was like, ‘I’m laughing out loud at something I’m working on.’ And then once I realized that, I was like, I love what I’m working on.”

This made it easier for Biz and the team to bear tremendous negativity in the first three years of Twitter:

“Everyone was saying how stupid Twitter was… And if I wasn’t emotionally invested and loving it, I would have believed everyone.”

A lot of people think they have have an idea for a startup that “other people will like”. But Biz believes this is a trap:

“I think that’s the wrong way to go. You have to love what you want to do. That’s my one piece of advice: Have an emotional investment in your work and you will be far more likely to succeed.”
