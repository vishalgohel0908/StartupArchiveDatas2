You only have to be right once

A long-term mentality is the single-most important indicator of an entrepreneur’s success

To operate at peak performance, you have to learn how to tame your mind

Naval’s checklist for starting a company

Investors know how difficult startups are

The curse of venture capital

#1 You only have to be right once
In the clip below, Naval reflects on how it took 13 years after starting his first startup when he was 23 before founding AngelList.

“Entrepreneurial ventures fail all the time. Most of my companies failed. I actually started seven companies, and I’ve launched about 40 or 50 projects over my career. And AngelList is the first one that I would truly say is product, market, entrepreneur fit for me that might succeed down the road.”

He tells the audience:

“It’s a low hit rate over your career, but you only have to be right once… So just keep trying, just keep iterating… a lot of it is market timing and you learn a lot of lessons.”

In his essay How To Be Successful, Sam Altman writes:

“’I will fail many times, and I will be really right once’ is the entrepreneurs’ way. You have to give yourself a lot of chances to get lucky.”
