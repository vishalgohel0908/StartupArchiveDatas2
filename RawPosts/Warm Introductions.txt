Naval Ravikant’s advice for getting a meeting with an investor

In the clip below, Naval explains:

“You have to understand that their time is being assaulted in all directions…. you have to respect their time as much as you respect your own.”

This means:

Don’t insist on in-person meetings

Qualify the leads first

Send them something in writing

Get a very good introduction from someone who’s trusted

Don’t be secretive

Don’t browbeat them into an in-person meeting or a phone call

“Let them screen it first via text or a summary or a business plan. And then if they request it, you can follow up with an in-person meeting.”
