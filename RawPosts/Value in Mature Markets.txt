Zynga co-founder Mark Pincus explains why you shouldn’t overlook mature markets


“Mature markets that are already big are actually amazing places for of us to go and innovate and think about new ideas. There's already revenue. There's already customers. There's already buying behavior.”

Google’s impact on search is one of the best examples.

“Google was the 55th search engine, not the first. Search was over. Like, ‘What are you doing here? This is Excite, Lycos, and Yahoo.’ Google showed us that there was a level of innovation in search that would make search something different in our lives.”

Pincus says he saw a similar dynamic within gaming in 2007.

“Gaming was a crappy business. It was declining. Casual gaming was the worst... It wasn't even a top ten internet consumer activity… [but] my belief was that if we made games accessible to people, social, and useful, that it could be one of the top adults pastimes. That was the big belief.”
