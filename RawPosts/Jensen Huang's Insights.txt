#1 How to attract the best talent in the world
“Our company chooses projects for one fundamental goal. My goal is to create an amazing environment for the best people in the world… [and] to create the conditions by which they will come and do their life’s work?”

As Jensen explains, the key to doing this is not by fighting for market share in commodity markets. It’s by choosing projects that are incredibly hard to do.

“[A great person] wakes up in the morning and says, I want to do something that has never been done before, that’s incredibly hard to do, that if successful, makes a great impact on the world.”

This is why NVIDIA doesn’t make cell phone chips, CPUs or do fabrication.

“We naturally selected ourselves out of commodity markets. And because we selected amazing markets and amazingly hard to do things, amazing people joined us… That’s how you build something special. Otherwise you’re only talking about market share.”
