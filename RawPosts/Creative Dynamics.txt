Naval Ravikant: “Human creativity is non-linear”

“The right idea can be worth almost infinitely more than the wrong idea. And so it’s only a small number of innovators that are needed to really drive any endeavor you can imagine…. Assembling a small number of the right people to interact with each other will drive everything.”

Naval continues:

“Every revolution - whether it’s scientific, political, technological, or physical - is driven by a small number of like-minded people who are at the cutting edge of thought, getting together and brainstorming with each other.”

This is as true of the Founding Founders as it is of many of the great companies in Silicon Valley. Naval argues:

“You just need to figure out how to get a small number of very innovative people in the same idea space together and cooperating with each other to create the next round of institutions… A few dozen, a few hundred, a few thousand people can come up with the right ideas that will completely change things for everybody.”
