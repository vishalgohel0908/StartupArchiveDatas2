Airbnb founder Brian Chesky on “living your product” and why slow growth can be invaluable
“When you’re starting a company, it never goes at the pace you want… You start it and you imagine everything’s going to be linear… and you think everyone’s going to care. And no one cares. Our first hundred users, I was related to. Or Joe [Gebbia] was related to.”

However, as Brian explains, this slow growth in the beginning made Airbnb a better company:

“It actually turned out to be really good that we were so unpopular in the very beginning because I had the opportunity to meet every one of our early customers. I actually think it made us a better company. If we took off in the early days, I would have never known all of them.”

LinkedIn cofounder and venture capitalist Reid Hoffman adds that Brian’s obsessive focus on the customer was one of the core reasons he invested in Airbnb.

Brian recounts how he actually lived on Airbnb in San Francisco for almost a year—staying at a different house every 3-5 nights:

“I learned all the issues about our website… Your customers aren’t going to email you the things that are truly important. You almost have to be with them and get that really subtle signal. It’s all about living your product. If you work at Facebook, it’s pretty easy to use your product every day. If you are using a site that allows you to go somewhere else in the world, you’ve got to be creative.”
