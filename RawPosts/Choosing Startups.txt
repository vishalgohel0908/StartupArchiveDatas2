iPhone co-creator Tony Fadell on how to choose a startup to work for

Tony Fadell is the co-creator of the iPod, iPhone, and Nest.

In the clip below, he gives his advice for choosing where to work:

“What do you want to learn, and who do you want to learn from?”

He continues:

“You don’t just go and say ‘I want to work at Google’ or ‘I want to work at Apple’. You want to go to a certain team with a certain set of people and work with them on something that you’re really curious about… Most people go where they can make the most money in their position, but you should be starting with the ‘why’: what’s your curiosity and what do you want to learn? I took the lowest job on the totem pole at General Magic because I wanted to get in there to work with the right team… The way you figure out what you want to do in life is by figuring out what you don’t want to do.”
