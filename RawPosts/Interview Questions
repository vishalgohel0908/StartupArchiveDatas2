Eight Sleep founder Matteo Franceschetti's five favorite interview questions

Matteo Franceschetti is the founder of Eight Sleep (which was valued at $500M in 2021).

On the 20VC podcast with Harry Stebbings he shares the five interview questions he asks every potential hire:

1. How did you find your previous jobs and what did they hire you for? It’s a really great sign if they were recommended by someone. If it didn’t happen, it’s not necessarily a red flag though.

2. What’s your biggest achievement? The best people come back with data (e.g. “I improved the CVR of the website from 8% to 9.2% by doing A, B, and C”). If answers are fluffy (e.g. “I bonded with my team”), that’s not a great sign.

3. What has been your lowest point? A lot of people will complain when you ask them this. This can lead to valuable information.

4. Who is your manager and what are they going to say about you in the next reference check? This forces people to tell the truth about their relationship with their manager because they know you will double check.

5. Why did you leave? This is a soft way to ask if they were fired or why they left.

“When you do this for 5-6 jobs, you start seeing patterns.”
