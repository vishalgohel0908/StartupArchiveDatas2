Jeff Bezos: “Stress comes from ignoring things that you shouldn’t be ignoring”
“If I find that some particular thing is causing me stress, that’s a warning flag for me. What it means is there’s something that I haven’t completely identified - perhaps in my conscious mind - that is bothering me and I haven’t yet taken any action on it.”

Bezos continues:

“I find as soon as I identify it and make the first phone call or send off the first email message… Even if it’s not solved, the mere fact that we’re addressing it dramatically reduces any stress that might come from it.”

Stress, he argues, “comes from ignoring things that you shouldn’t be ignoring.”

”People get stress wrong all the time in my opinion. Stress doesn’t come from hard work, for example. You can be working incredibly hard and loving it. And likewise, you can be out of work and incredibly stressed over that.”
