Google founder Larry Page: “Invention is not enough”

"Invention is not enough. [Nikola] Tesla invented the electric power we use, but he struggled to get it out to people. And that had to be done by other people and it took a long time. [You have to] combine both things... invention and innovation, plus a company that can really commercialize things and get them to people.”

Larry believes companies are an agent of change if they are run well:

“I’m really dismayed. Most people think companies are basically evil. They get a bad rap. And I think that’s somewhat correct. Companies are doing the same, incremental thing that they did 50 years ago or 20 years ago. That’s not really what we need. We need revolutionary change, not incremental change.”
