Peter Thiel: “If you are in favor of innovation, founders have to stay in control”
“I think the founding period is the period when you have innovation. And once that’s over, it becomes a normal business that runs in a bureaucratic, mechanistic sort of way. And it’s a very important question - how can one enable the founding of these companies to last?”

Thiel points to Apple as the classic example:

“The judgement call the board at Apple in 1985 made was that computers were like Pepsi. It was just a marketing thing. There was going to be no more innovation in the computer industry. You could get rid of the founder, and you could replace the founder with someone who would run the business in a much more predictable, mechanistic sort of way. And that turned out to be a bit of a mistake.”

He continues:

“Sort of miraculously, Jobs came back and then we saw another 14 years of innovation… If you are in favor of innovation, you have to figure out ways for founders to stay in control as long as possible and to avoid selling a business or substituting someone other than the founder in as CEO.”
