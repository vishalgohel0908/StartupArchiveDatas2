Kevin Hale: Marketing is a tax you pay for not making your product remarkable

In the clip below, the YC Partner and former Wufoo founder (acquired by SurveyMonkey) is asked how founders should balance working on product with other company priorities like marketing.

He gives the following response:

“My feeling is you having to spend money on marketing and advertising is usually a tax you pay because you haven’t made your product remarkable. Word of mouth growth is the easiest kind of growth, and it’s how a lot of the great companies grow.”

He advises companies:

“Figure out how to have a story that people want to tell about your product where they’re the most interesting person at the dinner table. And then that person is your sales force.”
