Today we dive into 10 ideas from Peter Thiel:

Value substance over status

Why will the 20th employee join your company?

The difference between a mission-driven company and social entrepreneurship

Think of the future on three horizons

Differentiate as sharply as you possibly can

A charismatic leader who can bring out the best in people is underrated

All trends are overrated

Always pitch your startup to investors as a discount to the future

Building a great business is hard but possible

There is no wisdom of crowds

#1 Value substance over status
“One of the resolutions I came up with a number of years ago was to always value substance over status.”

In the clip below, Thiel shares that if he were giving advice to his younger self, he’d urge himself to ask: Why am I doing these things?

“I think if I’m honest about it, too much of it was driven by prestige and status—and not quite enough by the substance of really trying to learn things.”

Seven months into working at a prestigious law firm in New York after graduating from Stanford Law School, Thiel had a “quarter-life crisis” and quit.

“All you had to do was go through the front door, but peoples’ identities get so wrapped up in the things they compete for that it was inconceivable for people to actually do that.”

When he reflects on how he ended up in this situation, Thiel says:

“I think I had taken too many of these shortcuts of valuing what was prestigious and conventional over what I really wanted to do.”
