Spotify founder Daniel Ek explains why he doesn’t worry about competition from Google and Apple

In this interview from 2015, Daniel Ek is asked how Spotify will compete against tech giants like Google and Apple who recently entered the music space. He responds:

“Apple and Google do this and 10,000 other things. We’re specialized. We don’t do anything other than our own service. This is all I do every day. We think with that focus and the thousands - if not millions of hours - that we put into creating [our] experience, we will win.”

He continues:

“The way you win in this fast-moving world… is by being super focused on solving one problem better than anyone else and by moving faster than everyone else in solving that problem. It’s really simple if you think about it like that… Sooner or later you’re going to get defocused if you do a thousand things. You can’t do all 1,000 things super well.”
