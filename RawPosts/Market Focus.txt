NVIDIA founder Jensen Huang: "We never talk about market share"

Jensen’s mission as CEO of NVIDIA is to empower his employees to do their life’s work. Crucial to that mission is avoiding commodity work.

“We never talk about market share in our company… Why are you fighting people for market share? The whole concept of market share says there’s a whole bunch of other people doing the same thing. And if they’re doing the same thing, why are we doing it? Why am I squandering the lives of these incredibly talented people to do something that has already been done?”

Instead Jensen has built his company around “doing something that has never been done before.” And to demonstrate this, NVIDIA has walked away from many commoditized businesses in the past.

“That demonstrates very clearly to your employees that we’re not going to do commodity work. The combination of choosing the right work and walking away from the wrong work is the best way to create the conditions [for employees to do their life’s work.]”
