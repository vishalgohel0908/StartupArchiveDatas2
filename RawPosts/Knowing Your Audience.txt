Jeff Bezos: “You don’t understand my audience”

When Charlie Rose asks him if the iPad is a “Kindle killer” in this 2012 interview, Jeff gives an incredible response:

“It’s a very different product, and I can give you an example. If I came to you and said: ‘Charlie, I love your show, but we’ve got to sex it up. We need fast cuts and vicious arguments between your guests.’ You would rightly say to me: ‘Jeff, I love you man, but you don’t understand my audience. We have a cerebral conversation here. It’s what we do, and it’s how we’re differentiated.’”

He continues:

“When people come to me and say: ‘You’ve got to have full-motion video and color on the Kindle.” I say: ‘Why? You think Hemingway is going to pop more in color?’… You don’t understand my audience.”

Jeff goes on to explain that the vision for the Kindle is: a purposeful device for reading where no tradeoffs have been made—every single design decision is optimized for reading.

And knowing exactly who his audience is gives him conviction in the Kindle team’s design decisions—even when everyone at the time was saying that the iPad would crush them.

To drive home the point of just how different the audiences for the iPad and Kindle are, he points out:

“The #1 thing people are doing on their iPads right now is playing a game called Angry Birds… The #1 thing people are doing on their Kindle right now is reading Stieg Larsson.”

One of the laws of marketing is that if you try to make a product that appeals to everyone, it will end up appealing to no one. Jeff understood this as well as anybody, and this interview demonstrates that.
