Bret Taylor: What makes Mark Zuckerberg so unique is how long term he thinks

After cofounding FriendFeed and selling it to Facebook in 2009, Bret Taylor got to work closely with Mark Zuckerberg.

In the clip below, he reflects on what made Mark so unique:

“The thing that I think is so unique about him is just how long term he thinks.”

He continues:

“Everyone says they think long term, but [Mark] is always thinking a decade out when you’re thinking a year out…. He would always ask me questions like: And then what would happen? And then what would happen? And then what would happen?”

Bret jokes that you’d get to the 4th-order effects with Mark and you’d be like “I can’t take it anymore! I don’t know”
