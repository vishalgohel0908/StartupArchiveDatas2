Travis gives two pieces of tactical advice:

1. Write an inspired blog post “Write a truly inspired blog post that describes the company, the mission, the vision, how it's amazing, why you're amazing and why it's going to be amazing if that candidate comes and works with you.”

2. Inspired networking. “This isn't for everybody, but if you can really go out there and talk to everybody you know and find those amazing people, and inspire the people you know to help you find amazing people, you're going to do a good job.”

He continues:

“If you can do both of those, then what happens is you get amazing people quickly. And there's a few situations where I've seen that, but it doesn't happen very often. But if you do neither of those, you're going to have a mediocre team or no team at all.”
