Naval Ravikant’s advice to startup founders: “Stay small until you’ve figured out what’s working"

“Stay small until you’ve figured out what’s working. Steve Blank, who teaches at Stanford and started Epiphany among many other companies, defines a startup very nicely. He says a startup is a search for a scalable and repeatable business model. And so what you’re really doing is you’re searching, and until you’ve found that business model that you can repeat and you can scale, you should stay very, very small and very, very cheap.”
