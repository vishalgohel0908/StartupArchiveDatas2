Jeff Bezos on building a business strategy

As Jeff points argues in the clip below:

“You can build a business strategy around the things that are stable in time.”

He rallied the entire company around the idea that customers will always want low prices, fast delivery and vast selection. They then executed relentlessly on being the absolute best in the world in those three areas.

There’s lots of important things that go into a great company strategy, but I love this advice from Bezos because it’s super counterintuitive:

“I very frequently get the question: “What’s going to change in the next 10 years?” That’s a very interesting question.

I almost never get the question: “What’s not going to change in the next 10 years?” And I submit to you that that second question is actually the more important of the two.

You can build a business strategy around the things that are stable in time. In our retail business, we know that customers want low prices, and I know that’s going to be true 10 years from now. They want fast delivery; they want vast selection. It’s impossible to imagine a future 10 years from now where a customer comes up and says, “Jeff I love Amazon, I just wish the prices were a little higher.” Or, “I love Amazon, I just wish you’d deliver a little slower.” Impossible.

So we know the energy we put into these things today will still be paying off dividends for our customers 10 years from now. When you have something that you know is true, even over the long term, you can afford to put a lot of energy into it.”
