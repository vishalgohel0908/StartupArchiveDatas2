Deep Dive: Aggregating Bill Gurley’s thoughts on marketplaces

Legendary investor Bill Gurley and Benchmark—the venture firm he joined in 1999—have made billions of dollars investing Internet marketplaces, such as eBay, Uber, GrubHub, OpenTable, Zillow, Yelp and more.

Since Benchmark’s home run investment in eBay in 1997, Bill and the Benchmark team have been fascinated by Internet marketplaces. And fortunately for us, Bill has written quite a bit about what he has learned over the past 20+ years—from what makes these businesses so valuable to how you can tell if your idea for a marketplace is a good one.

Today’s post is a high-level overview of some of Bill’s ideas, with links to Bill’s writing if you would like to go deeper on any one topic.
