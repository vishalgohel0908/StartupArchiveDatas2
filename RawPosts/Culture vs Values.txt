Ben Horowitz explains the difference between culture and values
Citing the Bushido (”the way of the warrior”), Ben Horowitz explains:

“A culture is not a set of beliefs. It’s a set of actions.”

That’s why the title of Ben’s book is “What You Do is Who You Are”:

“It’s not what you tweet. It’s not what you believe. It’s not the values on the wall. It’s what you do—that’s who you are.”

This is why the samurai called them virtues rather than values:

“It’s only a thing if you manifest it. If you believe it, it's nothing. If you put it on the wall, it's nothing. If you actually do it, and everybody does it, and you have cultural cohesion, then it's a virtue. “
