Jony Ive recounts the time Steve Jobs called him vain

In the clip below, Jony Ive recounts the time he asked Steve Jobs to be less harsh in his critique of a piece of work.

When Steve asked “why?”, Jony replied: “Well, because I care about the team.”

Steve then said:

“No Jony, you’re just really vain. You just want people to like you. And I’m surprised at you because I thought you really held the work up as the most important—not how you believe you are perceived by other people.”
