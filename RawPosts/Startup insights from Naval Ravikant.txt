Naval Ravikant on why you don’t need to be secretive with your startup idea
“You can always recognize the first-timers because they’re too secretive. And you can always recognize the experienced ones because they don’t care. Once you’ve done these a few times, you realize how much execution, difficulty, and risk there is, and how hard it is to get people to listen to you and believe you. Eventually you end up shouting your idea from the rooftops, just in the hope that somebody will actually use the product. So you end up with the opposite problem.”
