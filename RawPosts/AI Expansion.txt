NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang explains why technology companies will be much larger in the age of AI
“I was told a long time ago that NVIDIA would never be larger than a billion dollars,” Jensen begins.

This forecast was obviously wrong. NVIDIA’s market cap today is almost $3 trillion.

Jensen argues that the markets for technology companies are going to be much larger in the future because the market for “intelligent work” is enormous:

“This is the extraordinary thing about technology right now… we’re in the manufacturing of intelligence. We’re in the manufacturing of work. And the world of tasks - doing productive, intelligent work - that market is enormous. Measured in trillions.”

He gives the auto industry as an example. Artificial intelligence expands the market from demand for cars to demand for autonomous chauffeurs:

“The problem becomes larger. The opportunity becomes larger… Don’t be surprised if technology companies become much larger in the future because what you produce is something very different.”
